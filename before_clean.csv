To do that, we’ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes it easy to find and book in-person or virtual care in all 50 states, across +200 specialties and +12k insurance plans.

We’re building something genuinely game-changing—an AI voice system that doesn’t just sound human but feels human. Imagine working on an emotionally intelligent voice that can persuade and connect with people and is set to redefine how AI conversations happen in real-time.

We’ve made fantastic progress already, but now we’re looking for a talented AI/NLP engineer to join our journey and bring this project to a whole new level. If you’re passionate about creating AI that engages, influences, and makes a real difference, this is your opportunity.

In this role, you’ll refine a system that adapts emotionally, integrates with a large language model (LLM) trained in psychology and behavioral change, and transforms machine-generated speech into a dynamic, human-like experience. Your work will be essential in crafting a voice that not only talks but drives action—whether it’s getting someone to make a decision or helping them feel understood.

You’ll have the chance to work on cutting-edge technology using the latest in TTS models, real-time sentiment analysis, and multilingual NLP systems. Together, we’ll create a voice system that feels personal and can operate seamlessly in multiple languages while adapting to different emotional and conversational needs.

What You’ll Do:

Optimize and enhance our current AI voice system using state-of-the-art TTS models such as Tacotron 2, WaveNet, or Coqui AI to achieve natural, emotionally adaptive speech.

Infuse emotional intelligence into the voice by adjusting intonation, pacing, and prosody, ensuring it responds fluidly to real-time conversational dynamics.

Collaborate on integrating a psychology-driven LLM (e.g., Llama 3.2 or GPT-3) to generate persuasive, behaviorally informed responses in real time.

Leverage real-time sentiment analysis tools (e.g., IBM Watson Tone Analyzer, Google Cloud Natural Language API) to dynamically adjust the voice’s tone based on the user’s emotional state.

Utilize multilingual NLP models like mBART or mT5 to ensure the voice can easily scale across different languages, maintaining both linguistic accuracy and cultural sensitivity.

Design conversational flows that balance empathy and assertiveness, crafting voice interactions that feel genuinely human while also being persuasive and compliant with industry standards.

Work closely with the team to deliver a voice that isn’t just functional but feels alive—responding like a human, engaging like a human, and influencing behavior like a human.

Who You Are:

You have proven experience in AI/NLP, specializing in voice synthesis and conversational AI.

You’ve built conversational agents or TTS models that feel more like talking to a person than a machine—bridging the gap between technology and humanity.

You understand the fine details of prosody, intonation, and emotion in voice systems and have successfully applied these to create emotionally intelligent voices.

You know how to integrate large language models like Llama 3.2, GPT-3, or mT5 for real-time, adaptive conversations that go beyond pre-scripted dialogues.

You possess strong communication skills in English, both written and spoken, and can explain complex technical concepts clearly and effectively. You’re comfortable collaborating across different teams and cultures.

Bonus: If you have experience with behavioral psychology or a passion for persuasion techniques and behavioral change, we’d love to hear about it!

You’re a problem solver who thrives on challenging projects, with a continuous improvement mindset and a drive to create something extraordinary.

What You’ll Bring:

5+ years of experience in AI/NLP development, with a strong focus on speech synthesis and conversational AI.

A proven track record of fine-tuning TTS models like Tacotron 2 or WaveNet, delivering emotionally expressive, human-like voices.

Experience with real-time sentiment analysis tools to dynamically adjust conversational tone and ensure the system responds to emotional cues.

Expertise in multilingual NLP models to scale voice systems globally, ensuring accuracy and sensitivity to different cultures and languages.

A deep understanding of creating conversational agents that not only engage but drive behavior, using ethical and persuasive techniques.

Fluency in English, with excellent communication skills, ensuring effective collaboration across diverse teams and the ability to explain complex AI solutions to non-technical stakeholders.

Why Join Us?:

You’ll be part of a groundbreaking project that’s setting new standards for human-like AI voice systems—combining AI, psychology, and behavioral science to create something truly impactful.

In this role, you’ll refine a system that adapts emotionally, integrates with a large language model (LLM) trained in psychology and behavioral change, and transforms machine-generated speech into a dynamic, human-like experience. Your work will be essential in crafting a voice that not only talks but drives action—whether it’s getting someone to make a decision or helping them feel understood.

You’ll have the chance to work on cutting-edge technology using the latest in TTS models, real-time sentiment analysis, and multilingual NLP systems. Together, we’ll create a voice system that feels personal and can operate seamlessly in multiple languages while adapting to different emotional and conversational needs.

What You’ll Do:

Optimize and enhance our current AI voice system using state-of-the-art TTS models such as Tacotron 2, WaveNet, or Coqui AI to achieve natural, emotionally adaptive speech.

Infuse emotional intelligence into the voice by adjusting intonation, pacing, and prosody, ensuring it responds fluidly to real-time conversational dynamics.

Collaborate on integrating a psychology-driven LLM (e.g., Llama 3.2 or GPT-3) to generate persuasive, behaviorally informed responses in real time.

Leverage real-time sentiment analysis tools (e.g., IBM Watson Tone Analyzer, Google Cloud Natural Language API) to dynamically adjust the voice’s tone based on the user’s emotional state.

Utilize multilingual NLP models like mBART or mT5 to ensure the voice can easily scale across different languages, maintaining both linguistic accuracy and cultural sensitivity.

Design conversational flows that balance empathy and assertiveness, crafting voice interactions that feel genuinely human while also being persuasive and compliant with industry standards.

Work closely with the team to deliver a voice that isn’t just functional but feels alive—responding like a human, engaging like a human, and influencing behavior like a human.

Who You Are:

You have proven experience in AI/NLP, specializing in voice synthesis and conversational AI.

You’ve built conversational agents or TTS models that feel more like talking to a person than a machine—bridging the gap between technology and humanity.

You understand the fine details of prosody, intonation, and emotion in voice systems and have successfully applied these to create emotionally intelligent voices.

You know how to integrate large language models like Llama 3.2, GPT-3, or mT5 for real-time, adaptive conversations that go beyond pre-scripted dialogues.

You possess strong communication skills in English, both written and spoken, and can explain complex technical concepts clearly and effectively. You’re comfortable collaborating across different teams and cultures.

Bonus: If you have experience with behavioral psychology or a passion for persuasion techniques and behavioral change, we’d love to hear about it!

You’re a problem solver who thrives on challenging projects, with a continuous improvement mindset and a drive to create something extraordinary.

What You’ll Bring:

5+ years of experience in AI/NLP development, with a strong focus on speech synthesis and conversational AI.

A proven track record of fine-tuning TTS models like Tacotron 2 or WaveNet, delivering emotionally expressive, human-like voices.

Experience with real-time sentiment analysis tools to dynamically adjust conversational tone and ensure the system responds to emotional cues.

Expertise in multilingual NLP models to scale voice systems globally, ensuring accuracy and sensitivity to different cultures and languages.

A deep understanding of creating conversational agents that not only engage but drive behavior, using ethical and persuasive techniques.

Fluency in English, with excellent communication skills, ensuring effective collaboration across diverse teams and the ability to explain complex AI solutions to non-technical stakeholders.

Why Join Us?:

You’ll be part of a groundbreaking project that’s setting new standards for human-like AI voice systems—combining AI, psychology, and behavioral science to create something truly impactful.
