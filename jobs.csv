Seeking Breakthrough Makers

Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) offers countless ways to change lives. Our diverse community of more than 20,000 Breakthrough Makers will inspire you to pursue passions, develop expertise, and drive innovation.

At CHOP, your experience is valued; your voice is heard; and your contributions make a difference for patients and families. Join us as we build on our promise to advance pediatric care—and your career.

CHOP’s Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

CHOP is committed to building an inclusive culture where employees feel a sense of belonging, connection, and community within their workplace.

We strongly encourage all candidates of diverse backgrounds and lived experiences to apply.

A Brief Overview

The mission of the Campbell Laboratory at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia is to ensure that every child with a rare genetic disease is diagnosed as quickly and accurately as possible. We believe that a promising approach is to use large language models (LLMs) to better understand our patients’ health and intervene in the electronic health record to facilitate diagnosis. We hope these approaches can help address inequities in the way genetic care is provided to patients from historically marginalized backgrounds. Our lab performs training of LLMs using both on-premises GPUs as well as by taking advantage of cloud-based resources. We are seeking a data scientist to assist with the collection, standardization, and analysis of data from the electronic health record and to assist in implementation of LLM training in the cloud. The data scientist will have the opportunity to work with physicians, nurses, and laboratory professionals to improve the care of children.

The data scientist will work closely in-person with the laboratory director, Dr. Ian Campbell, and other data scientists and trainees to advance the mission of the laboratory. The laboratory’s LLMs are implemented in Python (PyTorch, JAX) using data extracted from electronic health record (Epic) relational databases. Thus, familiarity with Python and basic SQL are required. The data scientist will contribute to reproducible research by committing high quality and well documented code to the enterprise and public GitHub.

The Campbell Lab is committed to diversity and strives to create an equitable work environment for everyone. Individuals from historically marginalized backgrounds are strongly encouraged to apply.

We know that sustainability is at the root of a more resilient future. Our 2023-26 Sustainability strategy, called “Roots of resilience,” focuses on protecting natural ecosystems, addressing climate change, and embedding sustainable practices across our operations.

Unpredictable weather, increasing temperatures, and rising sea levels cause both social inequalities and environmental disruption. We're building a net zero strategy, developing insurance products and services, and mobilizing to advance thought leadership and investment in societal-led solutions.

Incorporating ESG considerations into our internal processes and practices builds resilience from the roots of our business.

Manager, Data Scientist- Consumer Credit Risk Management Models and Data

Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in computing and machine learning technologies and operating across billions of customer records to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

Team Description-

Have you ever seen the headline in the news “ Banks Pass Federal Reserve Stress Tests ” and wondered how Capital One determines how much savings (or “capital”) it needs? Or maybe how we analyze the potential impact of the next recession? At the heart of these questions are sophisticated econometric loss models that help us understand the ways in which the economy impacts our loan portfolios and guide strategic decision making at the highest levels of Capital One.

In the Consumer Credit Risk Management Models and Data Team, we blend cutting-edge quantitative methods,with a deep understanding of our business, data, and regulatory environment to build and deploy predictive models for losses, account volumes and outstanding balances. These models drive key strategic decisions for loss allowances, stress testing, and capital allocation as well as informing our earnings calls and recession preparedness.

If this sounds interesting to you, join us! As a Data Scientist on the deployment & platform side of the team, you’ll be at the forefront helping us to usher in the next wave of disruption by using the latest technology to deploy, optimize and modernize model pipelines and execution platforms that enable machine learning models to provide powerful insights about our portfolio and growth opportunities through new data sources. You will partner with best-in-class data scientists, analysts, and engineers to innovate solutions that directly impact the company’s bottom line in a meaningful way.
